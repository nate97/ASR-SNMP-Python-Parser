After we have the main application combining the exported SNMP variables and combined into
a dictionary, I'll need to work on managing how I will go about keeping records of the 
customer's data usage, a solution could be having multiple lists inside of the customer
dictonary.

Data usage also needs time stamps in them.

The layout of each individual statistic of data usage will be in a list, it will contain:
octetIn, octetOut, timestamp;
There may be up to two weeks worth of these lists in the customer dictionary for any given customer, so I will need to
work on how I'm going to go about managing all of this data, and how it's going to be exported, as well as work out a way
to manually add data to the exported yamls if need be.

Application will also need to be capable of importing yaml files? I'm going to need to think about this, I'm not sure
if that should be in this application directly.


May need seperate functions to deal with exported yaml files



Have application import curated list of other customer data so that
we can identify who's usage data goes to what customer, will need to be 
capable of being persistent and updatable.
