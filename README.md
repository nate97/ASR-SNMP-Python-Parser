# ASR-SNMP-Python-Parser

The goal of this project is to allow the easy viewing of customer traffic usage.

This will accomplish this by extracting ASR data and combining the data with ACTIVE E and GPON respectivly.

## Ideas
Eventually I would like to have a GUI for this application that allows you to easily sift through the historical records
of customer data usage, but for now, we're simply parsing and combining the data into a usable format.
